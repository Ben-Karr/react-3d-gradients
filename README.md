## To-Do:
* build stepper to step through gradient descent [x]
* build option to use debug/fixed ys []
* add MAE/RMSE [x]
* style page [x]
* select different critics and adjust loss-surface (adjust update function in Surfcae.js) [x]


Maybe add an onChangeCommitt to the sliders to force trace clear when sliding off the bar
