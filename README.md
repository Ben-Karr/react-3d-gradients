It uses the following technologies:
* [react](https://reactjs.org/) for state management,
* [mui](https://mui.com/) for UI components,
* [react-plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/react/) for 2D and 3D plotting,
* [react-katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-katex) for TeX support,
* [d3](https://d3js.org/) for data generation,
* [gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to deploy to Github pages.

If you want to run the app locally you can clone this repo and run `npm install` from the root folder; `npm start` runs the app.
